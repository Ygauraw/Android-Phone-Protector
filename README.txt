This is an Android application which will protect your phone being theft. this will give you only basic functions and this can be further developed thinking many other areas.
If the phone get lost we can send a text message with a special pass code and my application will be triggered from it. I have an idea to develop this If someone has changed the sim. after triggering the app it will automatically identify the location and send it to the given number from a text message.
This is the basic Idea of the project. In developing this app I used Eclipse IDE.
